        A Few Things You Should Probably Hear
      </h2>

      <div className="space-y-6 text-base">
        <p>
          If you’re reading this, you probably already made up your mind.
          That’s fine. I’m not here to sell you on Erie, Pennsylvania, or talk
          it up like a tourism brochure. Think of this more like a quiet
          conversation at the kitchen table before you head out.
        </p>

        <p>
          Erie is not exciting in the loud, obvious way. No one moves here to
          “find themselves.” People come here to study, to work, to save money,
          or because life pushed them here for a while. And that’s okay.
          Not every chapter of your life needs fireworks.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re a student, you’ll make mistakes. You’ll stay up too late,
          eat worse than you should, and complain about the snow like it’s
          personally targeting you. That’s part of it. Just remember: classes
          matter more than parties, and the people you meet matter more than
          either. Choose both carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re moving here for work or a fresh start, here’s the honest
          truth: Erie rewards people who show up consistently. Jobs aren’t
          handed out, but they’re not impossible either. Talk to people. Say
          yes to small opportunities. Don’t wait for everything to be perfect
          before you begin.
        </p>

          When you want to leave campus, here’s what people actually do.
          Downtown Erie has a small rotation of bars and breweries — places
          like Lavery Brewing, Plymouth Tavern, Room 33, or Oliver’s Beer
          Garden in the warmer months. These aren’t wild party spots. They’re
          where people talk, watch games, do trivia, or sit longer than they
          planned to. Go with one or two people. Big groups usually don’t last
          long here.
        </p>
        <p>
          For food, don’t overthink it. Flagship City Food Hall is an easy
          starting point if you don’t know where to go. Diners around the city
          are reliable for breakfast when you’re tired and hungry. There are
          good small spots for tacos, pho, pizza, and Middle Eastern food if
          you’re willing to try places that don’t look impressive from the
          outside. Ask locals where they eat after work — that’s usually the
          right answer.
        </p>

          A practical note — because someone should say it — winters are long.
          You will need a real coat. You will need good boots. And if you have
          a car, you’ll need to learn how to drive in snow without panicking.
          This isn’t character building; it’s just preparation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Erie won’t impress you right away. It grows on you slowly. The lake
          is better than you expect. Summer goes by too fast. The quiet can
          feel heavy at first, but it also gives you room to think. Use that
          time well.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don’t have to love it here. You just have to be honest with
          yourself while you are. Learn something. Save some money. Build a
          few good habits. When it’s time to move on, you’ll know — and you’ll
          leave better prepared than when you arrived.
        </p>

          Wherever you’re headed next, remember this: do the basics right,
          take responsibility for your choices, and don’t confuse boredom
          with failure. You’re doing fine. Have any question?
